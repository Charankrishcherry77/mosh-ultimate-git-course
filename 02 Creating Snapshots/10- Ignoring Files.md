# 10- Ignoring Files

In almost every project there are some files we do not want git to track them. Like for example `.log` files.

For example I added a `logs` folder and a `.log` file, in te root directory of the project. `git status` will mark the new folder as untracked.

```zsh
‚ùØ git status
On branch main

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	logs/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

To ignore files we must create a special file called `.gitignore` in the root of the project. This file as no name just as an extension. In that we will add the files or folders we want git to ignore.

We can include as many files or folder we want and use patterns as well like `*.log` to include all log files.

In this case we add the folder `logs/` to `.gitignore`.
