# 11- Merge Conflicts

Very often when we are merging branches we run into conflicts. Conflicts happen when:

1. The same line of code was been changed in two different ways, in the merged branches.
2. A given file is changes in one branch, but delete in the other branch.
3. The same file is added in two different branches with different content.

* When conflict happens Git can not merge the branches automatically, and we must step in. main here
