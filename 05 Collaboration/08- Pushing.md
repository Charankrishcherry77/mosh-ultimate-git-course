# 08- Pushing

With the `git push <remote-repository> <name-of-branch>` command we can send (upload) our changes to the **Remote Repository**.

```zsh
git push origin main
```

It is also possible to abreviate this command and only run `git push`, by default Git assumes the **Remote Repository** **_`origin`_**, and it will also assume teh current branch.
