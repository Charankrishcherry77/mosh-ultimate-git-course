# 09- Amending an Earlier Commit

To amend an earlier commit we use interactive rebasing. With rebasing we can replay other commits on top of a commit. First we choose the commit we need to amend and pass it parent to the `rebase` command with the `-i` option, like `git rebase -i <commit>`.

We can modify one or more commits. Git will recreate each commit that goes through the rebase operation even if the are not edit.

In the above image suppose we only changed commit `B`, Git will recreate `C` and `D` to point not the new `B` commit.

Rebasing is a destructive operation because it rewrites history.

The `-i` option means we are going to interact with the rebase operation, stop it, make changes, continue it or abort it.

This command will open de default editor with a script, listing all the commits we need to rebase, and instructions to perform the `rebase` operation.

```zsh
‚ùØ git rebase -i 8527033
Stopped at 8441b05...  Add a reference to Google Map SDK.
You can amend the commit now, with

  git commit --amend '-S'

Once you are satisfied with your changes, run

  git rebase --continue
```

Here we can make the necessary changes, and then amend the commit. when we are done we run `git rebase --continue`, to continue the operation.

To abort the rebase operation in any point use the `--abort` option. `git rebase --abort`.

In a rebase operation, a change introduced in a earlier commit will be carried on thought the history.
